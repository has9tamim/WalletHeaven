Simple Password Manager With Cryptographic Encryption

Password manager with sqlite database. Could be extended to save whatever.

In order to not store encryption key in anywhere in the phone it uses 
half of a sha256 hash. Other half is used to make sure the password is
safe.

Encryption is done with AES256.


#TODO
- add more options to save
- add settings (can't think what I should add here)
